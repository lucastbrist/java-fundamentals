*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
        SELECT * FROM air_travel.flights WHERE flights.date = '2024-10-17';

*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
        SELECT * FROM air_travel.flights WHERE flights.date = '2024-10-17' AND origin = '1' AND destination = '2';

*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today
        SELECT first_name, last_name FROM passengers
        JOIN passengers_flights ON passengers.id = passengers_flights.passenger_id_fk
        JOIN flights ON flights.id = passengers_flights.flight_id_fk
        WHERE flights.date = '2024-10-17' AND flights.origin = '1' AND flights.destination = '2';

*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
        SELECT * FROM flights
        JOIN passengers_flights ON flights.id = passengers_flights.flight_id_fk
        JOIN passengers ON passengers_flights.passenger_id_fk = passengers.id
        WHERE passengers.id = '1' AND flights.id = '1';

*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
        SELECT * FROM passengers
        JOIN passengers_flights ON passengers.id = passengers_flights.flight_id_fk
        JOIN flights ON flights.id = passengers_flights.flight_id_fk
        WHERE passengers.id = '1' AND flights.id = '1' AND flights.date = '2024-10-17';

*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities
        SELECT count(flights.id) AS flights_amount
        FROM flights
        WHERE flights.origin = '1' AND flights.destination = '2';

*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
        --week
        SELECT count(passengers.id) AS passengers_amount FROM passengers
        JOIN passengers_flights ON passengers.id = passengers_flights.passenger_id_fk
        JOIN flights ON flights.id = passengers_flights.flight_id_fk
        WHERE week(flights.date) = week(current_date()) AND flights.origin = '1' AND flights.destination = '2';

        --month
        SELECT count(passengers.id) AS passengers_amount FROM passengers
        JOIN passengers_flights ON passengers.id = passengers_flights.passenger_id_fk
        JOIN flights ON flights.id = passengers_flights.flight_id_fk
        WHERE month(flights.date) = month(current_date()) AND flights.origin = '1' AND flights.destination = '2';

        --year
        SELECT count(passengers.id) AS passengers_amount FROM passengers
        JOIN passengers_flights ON passengers.id = passengers_flights.passenger_id_fk
        JOIN flights ON flights.id = passengers_flights.flight_id_fk
        WHERE year(flights.date) = year(current_date()) AND flights.origin = '1' AND flights.destination = '2';

*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
        INSERT INTO flights (plane, pilot, date, origin, destination, estimated_travel_time)
        values ('1', '1', '2024-10-17', '1', '2', '10 hours');

*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
        INSERT INTO tickets (flight, cost, passenger)
        values ('2', '600', '6');

*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
*
        UPDATE passengers
        SET meal_pref = "All Juice"
        WHERE id = '1';
