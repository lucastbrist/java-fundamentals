 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students

            SELECT * from students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)

            SELECT first_name, last_name FROM teachers where subject = "subject1";

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher

            select students.first_name, students.last_name FROM students
            JOIN teachers_students
            ON students.id = teachers_students.student_id
            JOIN teachers
            ON teachers.id = teachers_students.teacher_id
            WHERE teacher_id = '1';

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject

            select students.first_name, students.last_name FROM students
            JOIN students_courses
            ON students.id = students_courses.student_id
            JOIN courses
            ON courses.id = students_courses.course_id
            WHERE course_id = '1';

 *          e. update a record in the student table

            UPDATE students
            set first_name = "Lucas", last_name = "Brist"
            WHERE id = '1';

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
 *
            INSERT INTO teachers (first_name, last_name)
            Values ("Lucas", "Brist");

 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.

 *        (done)
