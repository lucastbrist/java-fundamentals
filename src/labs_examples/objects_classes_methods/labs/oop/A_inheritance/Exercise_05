Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

ANSWER: Both "Parent called" and "Child called" will print, in that order. This is like in exercise 3.
There is no overriding, so both are called in succession and then printed.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
